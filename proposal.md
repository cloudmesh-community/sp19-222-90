===

We will be implementing a REST service that will retrieve the 2002-2019 NFL Combine Stats. We will compare this data with the incoming offensive skills players combine data from 2019, in order to find a previous NFL player that the rookie is most statistically similar to. Based on this comparison, we will analyze the fantasy data from the determined most similar player, and rank the rookies based on their comparisons total fantasy points from the 2002 - 2018 seasons. 

Who should be my top draft pick in this years fantasy football draft? This is a question that has plagued Americans since the creation of fantasy football, and this REST service will answer that question. This would be helpful for those trying to predict what new players they may want to draft to their team.
