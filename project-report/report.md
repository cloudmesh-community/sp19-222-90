## Abstract

TBD

## Introduction

Who should be my top draft pick in this years fantasy football draft? This is a question that has plagued Americans since the creation of fantasy football, and our project will finally provide an answer to that question. We will be implementing a REST service that will retrieve the 2002 - 2019 NFL Combine measurements and Fantasy points scored for QB’s, WR’s, RB’s, and TE’s over their individual careers. We will use this data to compare players who participated in the 2002 - 2018 combine, with the incoming offensive rookies combine data from 2019. This will allow us to find an NFL player that the rookie is most statistically similar to. Based on this comparison, we will analyze the fantasy data from the veteran player, and rank the rookies potential for success based on the veterans total fantasy points scored from the 2002 - 2018 seasons.

## Requirements


### Images

Image locations that start with http are not allowed. All images must be in an images folder within your directory.

All images must be referred to in the text. The words bellow and above
must not be used in your paper for images, tables, and code. For code you could use 

> In the previous

> In the following 

> As explained next

> We install the softwere with

BUT DO NOT USE THEM FOR IMAGES, ANY IMAGE MUST HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAPTION AS SHOWN IN OUR EXAMPLE

Comment: Above and bellow in a paper means you ask the reader to look at their shoes or the ceiling :smiley:.

+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice figure exported from Powerpoint
to png. If you like you can use this as a basis for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

Figures must not be cited with an explicit number, but automated
numbering must be used. Here is how we did it for this paper:

```
+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice
figure exported from Powerpoint to png.
If you like you can use this as a basis

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```

If the paper is copied form another source you MUST use a citation in the caption. 

![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorthertwo}

This is done as follows
